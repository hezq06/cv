abstract: Commissioning of a large accelerator facility like FRIB needs support from an online beam dynamics model. Considering the new physics challenges of FRIB such as modeling of non-axisymmetric superconducting RF cavities and multicharge state acceleration, there is no readily available online beam tuning code. The design code of FRIB super-conducting linac, IMPACT-Z, is not suitable for online tuning because of its code design and running speed. Therefore, the Fast Linear Accelerator Modeling Engine (FLAME), specifically designed to fulfill FRIBâ€™s online modeling challenges, is proposed. The physics model of FLAME, especially its novel way of modeling non-axisymmetric superconducting RF cavities using a multipole expansion based thin-lens kick model, is discussed in detail, and the benchmark results against FRIB design code is presented, after which the software design strategy of FLAME and its execution speed is presented.
