abstract: The new software FLAME has been developed to serve as physics model used for on-line beam commissioning applications. FLAME is specially designed to cover FRIB modeling challenges to balance between speed and precision. Several on-line beam commissioning applications have been prototyped based on FLAME and tested on the physics application prototyping environment. In this paper, components of the physics application prototyping environment are firstly described. Then, the design strategy and result of the four major applications -- baseline generator, cavity tuning, orbit correction, transverse matching, are discussed.
