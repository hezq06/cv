abstract: S-LSR is a compact ion cooler ring built in ICR, Kyoto University, aiming at creating ultra-low temperature ion beam by laser cooling. In order to approach lowest possible temperature at S-LSR in an experiment, parameters of laser cooling should be carefully chosen by simulation. This paper mainly concerns optimization of laser cooling parameters and prediction of possible low limit of beam temperature at S-LSR. Firstly, the adiabatic capture process of ion beam is introduced and studied. Then, different laser profile parameters are compared and an optimized value is chosen. After that, optimized solenoid field strength for 3-D coupling is proposed. At last, by choosing the parameters proposed, the lowest beam temperature achievable for S-LSR is predicted to be 10 K in transverse direction and 0.05 K in longitudinal direction.
