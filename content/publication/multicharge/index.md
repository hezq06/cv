abstract: The traditional linear envelope model is widely used in linac design and on-line tuning. However, for the simultaneous acceleration of multicharge states, the associated transfer matrix acts differently on each species with different charge to mass ratios and the traditional linear envelope model cannot be utilized. A direct way to handle multicharge state acceleration is by using multiparticle tracking, which can be high in model detail, but is typically lacking in computational efficiency to the extent where it is not suitable for on-line beam tuning of a linac. In this paper, a new approach of adapting a conventional linear envelope model to multicharge state acceleration is developed. The lattice of the proposed Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is used to test this technique in both the linac and the bend/folding segments of the machine. Results are benchmarked with the multiparticle tracking code IMPACT to both verify the accuracy of the model and clarify improvements in computational efficiency.
