abstract: Non-axisymmetric RF cavities, such as quarter-wave resonators (QWRs), can produce axially asymmetric multipole field components that can influence beam dynamics. For example, dipole components can cause beam steering, an effect that has been well known to the community since 2001. However, higher order multipole field components, such as quadrupole components, which have potential influence on beam dynamics, have never received enough attention yet. In this paper, we choose FRIB QWRs as an example and quadrupole components are extracted by multipole expansion. Then, influence of quadrupole components on a single cavity is studied using thin lens model. After that, the influence of quadrupole components on a whole FRIB linac segment one is studied, and effects such as transverse profile ovalization and blow up of beam size are witnessed. Lastly, a possible way of quadrupole components compensation for FRIB driving linac is discussed.
